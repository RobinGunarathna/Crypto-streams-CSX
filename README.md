There is also a sign up form on the website for those who want to have an account ready for when we go live.



## Features

This website is a 2 page website with 4 sections on the main page.

### The 4 sections

#### The first section (header and marketing)

This what the user will se first when the user comes to the website.

The navbar is on the top of the website.

The logo is right under the navbar.

Under the logo there is a image you can click on that will take you to DEXTools to check the live price of our token.

And under the DEXTools image there's some advertisement.

#### Navigation

The navbar helps the user to navigatet easily through 3 of the 4 sections on the website.

The navbar is fixed so it moves up and down with the user.

You can't press on the navbar to get to the first section of the website.

## Typography and color scheme

Text font from google fonts link: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton#standard-styles

for the color scheme i started with red and black theme on the website but it did not look so good.
I changed the color scheme to white, red and black. I still think that it does not look good but it looks a bit better atleast.

## Testing

I tested that this website works in: Google chrome, Microsoft edge and google chrome on my phone.

I tested this websites responsiveness using devtools device toolbar.

Everything looks good except for one thing. the website is allmost fully responsive it's just a small thing that i can't figure out no matter what.
There is still something that goes beyond the width of smaller devices so you can scroll a little bit left and right.

##  Deployment

I deployed the website with github-pages.

1. I had to change the main page file name to index.html so it loads up correctly.
2. In the Github repository. I navigated to the settings tab.
3. From the source drop-down menu I selected the master branch.
4. After I selected the master branch I waited a minute or two and got the deployed working link.

## Bugs

Only bug I have is the one with the responsiveness that i explained in the "Testing" section of the readme.
I've asced for help in slack, tutor assistance atleast twice just about this, my mentor, youtube and google.
No matter what I've done i havent been able to fully fix it.
Last time i asked about this from tutor assistance it allmost got fixed they told me to use the extension unicorn to see what's causing this.
I managed to sort the most of it thanks to the lovely tutors but I can't find the last things that are causing this responsiveness issue.
when I look at it with unicorn I can see that there is something that is going beyond the width of the smaller device sizes but it's not clear what it is.
I've managed to sort allmost all of it but from what i can see in unicorn it should be 2-3 elements that goes beyond the smaller width sizes.

I just noticed another bug.
the dextools image does not load on github pages but it loads everything when I run a server in gitpod.
I've checked and all the files are were they should be.
This bug cleared on it's own.
